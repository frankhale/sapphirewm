Sapphire Window Manager - History 
---------------------------------

Sapphire was originally developed from the aewm window manager by
Decklin Foster <decklin@red-bean.com>. aewm can be found at 
http://www.red-bean.com/~decklin/aewm/. I've been given permission by 
Decklin Foster to release my changes to aewm under the GPL. I thank him 
greatly for that!!!

Sapphire also borrows the image code from Blackbox by Brad Hughes.
